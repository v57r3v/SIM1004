Overview 
In this assignment, you will create two simple animated images in MATLAB. The images are: 
• A Sad-Happy Face 
• A Moving Vehicle 
You may refer to examples of similar images provided in Spectrum. However, you are encouraged to 
design your own animated images while adhering to the main concepts. 
Once the images are created, the user should be able to type either ‘Happy face’ or ‘Moving vehicle’ to 
display the corresponding animated image.

APPENDIX 
Circle Equation 
A circle equation is described by 
where    and    are the point coordinates on the circle line.     
 and     
 are the coordinates of the center of 
the circle.    is the radius of the circle and    is the circle angle ranging from 0 to 2  . 
   is the semi-major axis,    is the semi-minor axis, (  0,   0
) is the center coordinates and    is the rotation 
angle. 
 
To plot an ellipse in MATLAB, use function fimplicit.
